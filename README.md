# CBH-thermo

This repository contains scripts to compute heats of formation of adsorbates by combining experiment results and DFT calculations in a connectivity-based hierarchy. The method has been applied to a test set of 60 adsorbates with up to 4 heavy atoms on Pt(111). DFT calculations were performed with the BEEF-vdW functional.
